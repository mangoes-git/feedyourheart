      <p>
        FeedYourHeart Map aims to provide a centralized resource of affordable and culturally diverse food spaces for newcomer students living in Toronto. This resource takes the form of an interactive map, where students can find information about pricing, proximity to public transportation, and culturally-specific food and ingredients. We want to provide newcomer students with a resource that increases access to affordable food they miss to get a little taste of home!

      <span class="text-subtitle-1 font-weight-bold">Land acknowledgement</span>
      <p>
        The land we are standing on today is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and MeÃÅtis peoples.
      </p>

      <p>
        For indigenous peoples, lands and food are at the centre of what it is to be indigenous. In other instances, nomadic cultures required access to vast territories, which in turn ensured access to traditional foods. Tribal values of giving, sharing and trading are at the heart of land care and food sovereignty. As we know Toronto is built on stolen and sacred land and so every time we do or partake in a land acknowledgment we are all taking part in an act of reconciliation, remembrance and honouring the land and Indigenous Heritage which dates back over 10,000 years.
